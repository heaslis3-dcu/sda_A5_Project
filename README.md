RecyclerView, Dialog, Firebase, Camera Intent, Graphs;

App is unfinished:
Requires work on validation - first tab,

App uses Firebase storage to save data. Data is visible on second tab only when data is pushed to firebase.

App requires work on ordering of data in second tab it appears in a random order, 
second tab uses RecyclerView - each item is clickable, Dialog is used to view clicked item, though fragment or Activity was originally scoped. Further modification is required.

Responsive graph used on tab 3 - note code was modified (not very well) to pull data from firebase. The API used to build the graph does not support Firebase.
